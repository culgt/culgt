In pre-release version 2015-01-16 only Overrelaxation is included.

cuLGT comes with stand-alone lattice gaugefixing applications in lib/gaugefixing and
an interface to the MILC framework in lib/milcinterface.

Build lib/gaugefixing:
- Set an environment variable CULGT_HOME to the root directory of cuLGT.
- In lib/gaugefixing/CMakeLists.txt adjust parameters (like arch=sm_xx to your architecture).
- Run cmake and make (mkdir -p build;cd build;cmake ..;make)
- Currently the filetype is set to .mdp filetype
  (or more precisly it can read any files that consist of a header and the gauge field stored in the same order as in mdp files)
  With QCDUTILS by Massimo Di Pierro mdp can be converted to and from many known formats (NERSC, MILC, LIME, ILDG, 
  SciDAC).
  For the manual see http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4813 and the Python source code can be downloaded 
  at http://code.google.com/p/qcdutils/
- Run the application! For example test on a random lattice with ./LandauGaugeSP --sethot 1 

The MILC interface is experimental.

Known issues:
- Large lattices are not supported at this stage for compute capability < 3.5 (disable texture use as workaround)
